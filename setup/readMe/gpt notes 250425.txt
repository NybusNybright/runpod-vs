Project Setup Summary for RunPod Environment

We have completed basic setup:

SSH connection from local machine to the RunPod pod is working.

Local project files are organized under C:\Users\Home\git\runpod-manual\.

Local .code-workspace for VS Code exists but is not critical to workflow.

A zip file with the project structure and code is attached

Project Workflow:

Sync Details:

rsync will be used to push local changes to the pod.

Pod will mirror local files exactly.

Never pull from the pod back to local.

Goals:

Keep the local machine as the source of truth.

Protect against pod resets.

Use Git checkpoints locally when major changes are made.

Keep workflow simple, manual, and reliable.

Please help continue from this point.
